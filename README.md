**Assessment Brief**  
_To individually create a CRUD application which use all the core tools, methodologies and technologies covered by the GMCA DevOps course. These include Agile, Continuous Integration, Cloud Fundamentals and software development languages/operating systems including Linux, Python & Flask._

**Solution**  
_ A tool-share app which allows users to share neighbours tools._  

**Tech Stack**  
_a Minimum Viable Product which covers_   
**1. KANBAN BOARD** using [this Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/oqz3rjmG/assessment) containing user stories, use cases, tasks including task backlog and Moscow analysis.  
**2. DATABASE**: GCP Mysql relational database 'tool-share' with three tables; Users, Tools & Users_toolbox.  
**3. CRUD APPLICATION BACK-END** in Python programming language, saved as a Git Repository.  
**4. FRONT-END & INTEGRATED APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE(API)** using Flask HTML.  
**5. UNIT TESTING ENVIRONMENT(TDD)** using Pytest. Proof of high test coverage using test reports.  
**6. VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM(VCS)** using code fully integrated into the GitHub Version Control System using the Feature-Branch model.  
**7. CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION(CI) SERVER** using Jenkins.  
**8. ERG DIAGRAM** using draw.io.  
**9. Risk Assessment**.  
**10. Deployment** using Jenkins automation to build, test and deploy, with a webhook to GitHub which was triggered with every push event.

**Use Case**  
_The sharing economy is much vaunted with privately owned assets using web apps to timeshare resources (eg: AirBnB,Carshare, Storage). This application will allow users to benefit their local community and themselves by pooling their gardening, DIY, cooking equipment)_  

**Deadline**  
_Latest Github commit on 9am Monday 23rd March 2020._   

**Product enhancements**  
_The present app lets users search for tools that they can lend. Future iterations might show types of tools, images, add rental periods, or links to commercial tool hire sites which generates click through revenue. It could also have geographic locations on drop down menus such as those used on Gumtree based on willingness to travel to pick up the tool._
